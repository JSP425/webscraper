# Project Explanation

This is my first webscraping project. The intention is to be able to collect targeted data from sites such as Craigslist and write it into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.

The current model tests searching for bikes but is intended to work with other categories later.

The committing of project in Git is inconsistent as I am also practicing branching/merging and initiating these actions from the terminal.
